<!-- TITLE: Funding Bookmark -->
Bookmark's projected annual operational cost is $5430. In order to continue the operation of Bookmark as a service, we need to ensure that this cost can be payed. Here are some proposed solutions:

## Paid Advertising

Advertising often goes awry and is difficult to control. On top of that many users dislike seeing ads on the page when they are focused on reading.

## Donations

Perhaps the easiest but most unreliable way to get donations.

## Premium Services

We can offer extra services to sites that subscribe to "premium". These services would cost some monthly fee such as $10 (or some annual fee like $100). Some example premium services:

- Non-consecutive chapter version diffs
- Automatic backups
- The ability to have more than 5-10 revisions at a time
- Increased character limit when writing chapters
- Move to a more powerful, dedicated server (this process can be automated via specific DNS rules)

We should take care not to put core features behind a paywall.

## Author Donation Transaction Fees

Authors have the ability to take donations through Bookmark and have the platform automatically release new chapters etc when goals are reached. Perhaps we can take some **small** percentage of these donations as some sort of transaction fee. A maximum transaction fee percentage of 2% is proposed. When a fee of 2%, assuming $1000 is donated to **all** authors on a daily basis, Bookmark will make $600 a month--more than enough to cover operational costs.
