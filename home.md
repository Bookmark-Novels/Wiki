# Core Goals
Bookmark's core goals are simple and straightforward.

1. To provide an easy to learn and use platform for reading, writing, and sharing stories online.
2. To automate as much as possible so writers can do more of what they love.
3. To provide an amazing reader experience.

Bookmark does not care about what you're writing. You can publish original stories, write fan fictions, and translate foreign novels.

Bookmark strives to stay dedicated to writers and readers. Bookmark is not a blogging platform nor is it a CMS; Bookmark is a place to write stories.
