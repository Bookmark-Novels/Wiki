<!-- TITLE: Consul -->

Bookmark uses Consul for all configuration needs. By default, services will have access to a read-only KV store dedicated to their service. Developers will not be able to edit these KV-stores unless they are an approved contributor. To request access to Consul, please send an email to andrew@bookmarknovels.com.
