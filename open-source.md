<!-- TITLE: Our Stance On Open Source -->

While we believe in open source here at Bookmark, it is not wise to open all Bookmark resources to all contributors. Bookmark therefore publishes all source code to the general public however resources to run core services is restricted to Bookmark organization members. This does not mean somebody cannot just run Bookmark themselves, it just means only Bookmark organization members may use Bookmark internal resources for development purposes.

If you know somebody who is trustworthy enough to give access to internal resources, email me at andrew@bookmarknovels.com.
